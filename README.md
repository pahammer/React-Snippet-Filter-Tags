# React-Snippet-Filter-Tags
The code inside App.js includes a reusable react project snippet for building a filterable list from an object. The FilterableListComponent takes in two properties. [1]: An array of objects and [2]: A key name for which it builds simple pill components to toggle the visibility of the correlating elements.
